### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [RiotJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [AdonisJS] - awesome web-based text editor
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [jQuery] - for bootstrap function
* [webpack] -Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser
And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/kopigreenx/adovue)
 on GitHub.
